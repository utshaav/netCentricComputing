  - dotnet run

## Some useful commands

- Console.Write() => Writes in Console
- Console.WriteLine => Writes in Console with a additional linebrake
- Console.Read() => Reads from console

## Data Types

### Integers

- byte -> holds 8 bit data
- short -> holds 16 bit data
- int -> holds the most of the numbers we use
- long -> holds longest number

### Floting Numbers

- float -> lightweight (6-9 precision) (as default, compiler thinks the number to be double, so we must force it to float by f at the end, eg e = 234.5f)
- double -> 14-15 precision
- decimal -> heavyweight (highly precise) (as default, compiler thinks the number to be double, so we must force it to decimal by m at the end, eg e = 23.44667564325m)

### Characters

- char -> holds a single Character
- bool -> holds a boolian value

## Conventions

- classes -> pascal casing
- variables -> camel casing
